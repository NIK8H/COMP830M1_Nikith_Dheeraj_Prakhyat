# COMP830M1_Nikith_Dheeraj_Prakhyat
Team "Poisoned Python" we are developing a project for the academics major, members are Nikith, Dheeraj and Prakhyat.

## ATM Simulator
* The ATM Simulator is a Python program that simulates the functionality of an ATM. 
  Users can perform financial transactions such as checking account balances, 
  making deposits, and withdrawing funds without physically visiting a bank. 
  The project uses object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, 
  inheritance, and polymorphism to model the classes for the ATM, bank account,
  and transactions.

## Requirements
* To run the ATM Simulator, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer.

## Usage
* To run the ATM Simulator, navigate to the project directory in your terminal 
  and run the following command:
     ```
     python atm_simulator.py
     ```
* The ATM Simulator will display a menu of options to the user. 
* Follow the prompts to perform financial transactions.

## Classes
* The project consists of three classes: ATM, BankAccount, and Transaction.

## ATM Class
* The ATM class is responsible for displaying the menu of options to the user 
  and handling user input.

## BankAccount Class
* The BankAccount class represents a bank account and contains information such 
  as the account number, balance, and transaction history.

## Transaction Class
* The Transaction class represents a single transaction and contains information
  such as the type (deposit or withdrawal), amount, and date and time.
